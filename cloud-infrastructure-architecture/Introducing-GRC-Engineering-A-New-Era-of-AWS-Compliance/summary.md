- **Author**: AJ Yan (Aquia)
- **Talk Type**: Security/Compliance

## Summary

This presentation introduces the concept of GRC Engineering as the necessary evolution of traditional governance, risk, and compliance practices. The speaker argues that modern GRC must embrace technical skills and automation to remain relevant, demonstrating how AWS-native services can create a self-documenting compliance system that eliminates manual processes, reduces engineer burden, and provides continuous evidence collection for auditors.

## Key Points

- Traditional GRC practices are outdated and ineffective in modern cloud environments
- SOC 2 compliance has become a "joke" due to reliance on screenshots and manual processes
- GRC professionals must develop technical skills or risk becoming obsolete to AI and automation
- AWS Audit Manager can automate evidence collection from Security Hub, Config, and CloudTrail
- CI/CD pipeline outputs can be integrated into compliance frameworks using ASF format
- Self-documenting compliance systems eliminate engineer time waste and improve audit efficiency
- GRC Engineering bridges the gap between compliance theory and technical implementation

## Technical Details

**AWS Implementation Architecture:**
- AWS Audit Manager for central compliance framework and evidence collection
- Security Hub and Config for compliance status and historical tracking
- CloudTrail for API call tracking and audit logging
- Lambda functions for custom evidence processing and report generation
- Custom frameworks with organization-specific controls vs generic AICPA guidelines

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Convert SAST/DAST/dependency scan outputs to Amazon Security Findings Format
- Automatically feed scan results into Security Hub and Audit Manager
- Eliminate engineer interviews about development processes
- Provide real-time compliance validation in deployment pipelines

**Core Principles:**
- Continuous automation over periodic manual work
- Enable engineers versus burden them with audit requests
- Empower auditors versus manage their information access
- Focus on evidence quality over quantity
- Leverage existing tools rather than impose new GRC-specific solutions

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced engineering time spent on compliance activities
- Faster audit completion with higher technical confidence
- Elimination of annual compliance roadmap disruptions
- Strategic value demonstration versus traditional cost center positioning

All right, welcome everyone. Welcome, welcome. Find a find a seat if you can and uh and join us here for the session. Uh we appreciate you showing up here for uh for the talk. Um so this talk is going to be introducing GRC engineering, a new era of AWS compliance. Um and uh we want to thank our sponsor uh Whiz.io. Um you can reach them online at whiz.io. Uh or you can try to take a sticker from a table in the lobby and they will definitely try to talk to you. Um um uh and uh yeah, if you have any questions u for the talk um you can always use the Slack um post your question there. We'll ask it at the end or you can also just raise your hand. We'll bring the microphone around. You can ask it live. Uh with that being said, let's give a warm welcome to AJ Yan for introducing GRC engineering a new AWS a new era of AWS compliance. Thanks Evan. Welcome everyone. Uh I'm AJ Yan, director of GRC engineering at Aquia, author of the GRC engineering for AWS book. Uh and today we're going to talk about something that uh a term that some of you may have been hearing uh and seeing job titles popping up. Um GRC engineering that I think is much more than a job title. I think it's much more than a new buzzword. I think it's the next evolution and the necessary evolution of GRC. Uh so I'm going to kind of take you through a story. We're going to go back and and talk about where we've been with GRC, where kind of how we got here, that the challenges, the problems uh with the existing state, and then what GRC engineering is um and and what does this mean? And then we're going to walk through an actual real example on AWS uh showing how you can potentially build a self-compliant cloud. And we'll end with the core principles that that that make up GRC engineering. My goal is that at the end of this, if you are in GRC, you are motivated and excited to go out there and reshift um how you how you do your job on a day-to-day basis. And if you work with GRC folks, you you go home and say, "It's time for you to get technical GRC guy or girl. Uh we we can no longer deal with this." So, um hopefully I I accomplish that goal. So, I want to go back to 2017. I was a a sock 2 and I auditor. I was wrapping up uh an audit doing an afteraction review with the uh the founder and a COO and I'm going through, you know, going through the script. The founder interrupts me and he's like, "AJ, just got to say, man, like when you when I heard audit and I started to see these requests come in, I thought you were going to be like Toby from the office. I I I fully expected you to come in here and be this super dry dude. Pretty annoying and pretty weird. Um and uh I'm I'm shocked that you're not that." And I was like flattered, but I also was like, damn, is that what they think of us? It's like that what most people assume GRC professionals are. Um, and it was a little sad. And I was like, but I had to be real with myself and say, you know what, that's probably a good description. Um, that's probably how we how we look. We come in and ask some some pretty silly questions. And then if I fast forward to 2025, 8 years later, unfortunately, it hasn't changed. Um, when the auditor shows up, we still feel this way. Uh, we still think Toby from the office is coming in and and is going to ask us some dumb questions, ask us for screenshots that don't really prove anything for an audit that no one cares about. Um, and asking questions that don't make a ton of sense. Um, and that's unfortunate because 8 years later there's been no change. Um, and it's why we need GRC engineering. It's why we need this change. And I think there's no bigger example of why there needs to be a shift uh than SOCK 2. Uh, and if you follow me on LinkedIn, you've you've you've seen some of the stuff that I've said lately about Sock 2. And if you want some good entertainment, go check out those comments because there are people that are really upset with me right now um about this take. And um but I think Sock 2, frankly, has become a joke. Um and it's not because it's it's a bad framework. I think it's because of how it's being practiced today. Screenshots, manual checks, no real connection to security. Uh, and I have a ton of fun dunking on CPAs and auditors. Uh, and it and it's fun and I get some good laughs out of it. Um, but I think this is a really big problem because this is a compliance framework that a lot of GRC pros at early stage startups or mid-size companies are using to evaluate security. And I I want to improve SOCK 2. I I I have a bunch of LinkedIn learning courses about SOCK 2. I think it might be a little too far gone. Um but regardless of my opinion, we are using SOCK 2 reports today and thirdparty risk management to evaluate our vendors. There's in contracts they're saying, "Hey man, I'll do business with you, but you need to sock two first." And they have a sock too. Somebody gets the report, big old PDF full of accounting language that nobody reads. Um nobody understands, but yet we're making security decisions off of this. Uh which is scary. Uh frankly, that's a known known weakness that I think it's the loudest secret in security that sock 2 is a joke. Um if you talk to most security folks, engineers, developers, devop folks, etc., they're going to say, "Yeah, this it's pointless. Uh the the auditors are asking me crazy questions. My GRC professionals come to me once a year to bother me. They don't even care to ask what I do for a living or how I'm working. They just want a screenshot." Um and we must change um because uh if we're going to continue to leverage uh these uh frameworks, these reports, these audits for real security decisions, um it should be more technical. It should go more in depth and we should actually get back to focusing on security. And I think the reality is is that the old way just won't work. Um I know some of you were probably in the securing remote MCP servers. We've heard talks about AI agents. We just um we heard talks about using AI analysis on IA. The industry security industry has changed. The security industry has evolved. I've seen um how apps has gotten a lot better over the last 8 years. IM has gotten a lot better, but in GRC we're still getting screenshots. We're still asking for screenshots of security groups. It just doesn't make sense. Um we haven't evolved and it's time to evolve. Um and that's why and where I think GRC engineering comes in. So for me, GRC engineering really solves this problem by building compliance directly into the tech stack. Similar like we've seen with DevSec Ops of shifting security left, we need to shift GRC left as well. Um and instead of checking compliance after the fact, um we should make it impossible to deploy non-compliant resources and then be able to continuously monitor monitor it. Back in in 2018, I I wrote an article. It's my first ever article I ever published about automating compliance. Do not try to go find it. is very bad. Um, but I was trying to push this like GRC engineering concept back then. Um, and then kind of fast forward to 2020, I launched a company. Uh, and it was about automating compliance, kind of building on that GRC engineering principle. When we started to hire some GRC folks, I didn't want to hire a GRC analyst or a GRC consultant. I wanted a GRC engineer. this hybrid person that understood controls, that understood policies, but also could go have a conversation with the CTO, also could go have a conversation with an engineer and speak the language of these folks. Um, and I think it's really cool right now that we're seeing more and more of these GRC engineering roles pop up. Um, I am a director of GRC engineering. It really feels like my dream job right now uh at Aquia. I I manage a team of GRC engineers and some other folks and and get to be in the technical weeds every day. um like I was at the start of starting a company and if you ever start a company once you raise venture capital you don't get to do anything anymore um you just have to talk to VCs all day so I didn't get to do anything as a founder but now I get to do stuff and I think there's a lot of people that we're seeing and I don't think this is a coincidence I don't think this is by chance um that companies are investing in these roles because they know that the old way of doing GRC is not going to work um in this new era of of security and how we're doing business today um and the shift is happening I'm seeing a new role like this popping up every day. So, I think one as a GRC professional that has been interested in the technical side of what we do since the beginning of of really starting in this, this is super exciting. I'm I'm excited about where we're headed. I'm excited for what this means for for the GRC profession, but I have to keep it real. Um, I'm passionate about this. Obviously, I'm here talking at Forward Claus, wrote a book on this, but I fear for the GRC profession. I fear that if as a profession GRC professionals don't evolve, don't level up on our technical skills, the career path goes away. Uh why would companies hire someone who can only read policies and understand compliance frameworks but not translate that into technical requirements when they could probably empower a security engineer, a cloud architect, a DevOps guy or girl, um someone that understands a Python script, understands the cloud services and empower them with some tools and some training on the compliance side. And I know there's a lot of talk about what AI can't do and how AI is not going to change the world. The one thing AI can do today is read documents and spit something back out. And if that's all you're doing as a GRC pro, I'm sorry. You are an endangered species and you must change and we must level up. We need our auditors to level up. We need our GRC pros to level up. We need all GRC professionals to embrace the need and importance of technical skills. Uh I think in the past it was an eitheror. You could you could you could you know or you could potentially have technical skills at the GRC pro. That was a nice to have. I think those days are over. I I think it's an and now you must be a GRC pro that understands the compliance side as well as understanding the technical side. So for the next 10 minutes, what I'm going to do now that hopefully you all understand GRC engineering. I hear I see some nods. I see some confused faces. Um and I'll I'll try to fix those that confusion. Um but for the next 10 minutes, what we're going to do is walk through a scenario uh of what does this look like in reality? And while I have anonymized this a ton um to to not share any confidential information um this is a scenario where I think a lot of people find themselves in. You're a new director of GRC at this great company FFO Inc. Um they did a sock 2 last year and they found out uh that um it sucked um and you have been hired as this new director of GRC and the CISO told you that we wasted a ton of time last year. The road map got hijacked. The engineers I had three engineers quit because they got locked in a room with EY and you and our old director of GRC engineer uh leader left. Um and you need to fix this. We have 10 AWS accounts. We need a Sock 2 type 2. Oh, by the way, you don't get a tool. We're not investing in a GRC tool. We spent that money on your salary. So, you're on your own there. Um but I need this fixed. Um and you've been hired to change that. and you're like, "Hell yeah, that's what I do. I I'm GRC engineer. I know what I'm doing." Um, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to walk you through start at the end. We're going to start the end of what we did. I'm going to talk you through it, show you some examples in AWS, and we'll finish up with what the core principles are that enabled this to take place. And like I said, this is a scenario that folks find themselves in, get hired to come and solve the problem of last year's audit. Um, and you got three weeks to do it. And then this that the technical solution that I'm going to talk through is something that um I've deployed um and and and deployed at several places and I've seen work um not just in like a small environment but environments with 100 plus uh AWS accounts. Um so the solution is really this self-documenting cloud compliance system that is going to automate um almost all of the technical controls on your infrastructure and and and software layers. Um and it all starts with these AWS native services. Uh so because at FFO Inc. Um we have some dev a good dev sec ops team and good security ops team. Um they're already using cloud trail they're already using config using security hub using the CIS benchmarks the foundational security best benchmark standards. Um so they already got some good kind of uh plumbing there from a security perspective multi-account structure have everything living in the security account and feeding it there from those different accounts. So what you're going to go do out go do is use audit manager and and I'll tell you four or five years ago I was the biggest hater of audit manager. A huge hater. I wrote like a four-part blog hating on it so bad. Um, and I become a believer of it. Um, because it speaks the language of the auditors. And if anybody knows anything about this profession, you can do some cool stuff, but if you don't speak the language of the auditors, it does not matter. Um, they're going to still ask for things um that don't make sense. So, what we set up here is a custom framework in audit manager. And when I say custom framework, just think controls that make sense. Often times GRC pros find out I got to be sock 2 compliant. So they go download the AICPA sock 2 guide and throw that at their engineers and say these are the controls we need to do and nobody knows what those controls mean that they have in that guide. So actually write some controls that make sense for your organization that speak the language that you speak and build out this custom framework. When you're doing that, um, you get to identify what data sources do you want to collect evidence for this thing. And you can say security hub, those security hub rules that are already in place from the dev from the security team. Config rules as well. You want to have both. Security hub is going to give you that compliance status failed or not or or passing. And config is going to give you that historical tracking. Um, so your auditors can stop asking those stupid sample questions. Uh, you can just show them that over time this actually did work. Um, and then cloud trail obviously is is tracking every API call. Alo feeds in there. So you have this custom framework set up. You then create an assessment from that framework. And once you create that assessment, 24 hours later, evidence is flowing in to every single one of those controls. And I'll give you a quick example of what this looks like. What you're looking at here is an example control AC2 um where you see some security hub um evidence flowing in here. Uh every day there's a folder created. So this is the June 30th folder um where you're going to see some of this evidence flowing in. Um, if you click into one of these, you'll be able to see a bunch of metadata around the description, some remediation information, um, uh, details about the the check and what it's checking. Uh, so every single day, sometimes it's, you know, timing on AWS can be weird. So, it's not the same time every day for some reason, but every day at some point, evidence flows in there. There's a nice little evidence folder that you can go out and retrieve. And we'll talk about how you go out and retrieve that and make it digestible for for auditors. Um, but a lot of times there's there's a lot of ways to automate your infrastructure. Uh, you can have a GRC tool out there. You can have some CSPM tools out there like Prowler or Electric Eye or maybe you have another tool out there that um we've seen here today that that some folks have that you can automate the infrastructure. But then we get to SDLC and the GRC Pro goes absolutely not. I am not going to even try to talk about this with the auditor. I'm just going to go call the engineer and make him go sit in the room. And that's how at FFO we lost three engineers um because they had to sit in the room with EY and and that just didn't work. So what we're going to do now is take the good work that our dev sec ops team has done um in their CI/CD pipeline and pull that information in to audit manager. Um so what we did here is we took the regular scans that are occurring um we used GitLab there at FAFO and we took the outputs of the SAS DAS dependency scans etc and converted them to ASF Amazon security findings format that security hub likes um and then sent that data into audit manager and security hub. So now the auditors have all of their evidence in the same place for infrastructure and software changes and your engineers never have to talk with them because every time somebody pushes a change up and it makes it to production, they've already done this work. They're checking for this stuff. They've established what is the risk level that we can accept when we're doing this. And now you can just go grab that information. So your auditors aren't asking for let me get a list of those Jira tickets, man. Let me get a list of those pull requests. what exactly does this mean here on this? We're not doing that anymore. We're bringing that information directly into audit manager. Here's how this looks. When you send information into audit manager from via the API, it'll show up as a manual data source. But you can see you get all the details there. What was the scan? When did it happen? Time date stamps, um, control mappings, all of that good stuff. And then this is the past. If if if a scan fails and and doesn't go through, uh that information goes into security hub as a finding and then it gets put into whatever workflow you all have in security hub. Now, this is great. You can do all of this and then your auditors are going to say something that just is going to really piss you off. Say, "Hey man, this is cool, but I can I just get a screenshot? I don't really I don't like this automation stuff. This is kind of nasty. I don't know how to read this. How do I read JSON?" Well, you just read it, auditor, but whatever. Um, so we're we have a lambda function that we wrote that um is is going to go out and grab the evidence out of audit manager every week, put it into a nice pretty Excel sheet for the auditors. We call it an auditor friendly report. Um, so that they can see all of the nice pretty details that they would like. Um, and your auditors are happy sort of with this. They then say, "This is great, but I want to see the source evidence. I need to go see it directly from the source." You say, "You know what? We've already prepared for that. you have an IM role that has least privilege access, so you can't do anything to go to audit manager yourself, click into every evidence folder and go get that information. Um, so they can have their pretty Excel or they can go get it from the data source as well. Um, and to me, this is GRC engineering. This is the future of GRC. It's continuous evidence collection. It's transparency. It's empowering your auditors. And it's eliminating that waste of time with your engineers. And now, what's important is business impact. Obviously, we want to have a good impact and the impact was clear at FAFO. You were a hero without heroics. Uh people loved you to leadership teams. You were the GRC director who eliminates compliance friction and enabled rapid secure growth. The engineering team loved you because you protected their time. Uh you protected their time. You stopped them from having to answer dumb questions. You actually went and learned what they do. You found out they're doing some cool stuff in GitLab that you can go get and not making them redo work. um your your auditors actually like you because you made your audit more efficient. So you helped them out. You saved them from some very awkward conversations with engineers. Um and they got a better more technically depth um audience. And and to the GRC community, I think this is where we all can help advance this because you become the practitioner who proves modern compliance can be automated and strategically valuable. um can actually impact the business and then we can get back to what this is all about security. Um we can get back to making this a real security value. So the core principles that kind of enabled this that I think are super important to to hit on here is obviously continuous automation over periodic man uh manual work. I think it's super important to look at those second and third bullet points. Um we want to enable our engineers um versus burden them. We want to empower our auditors versus manage them. Um, we want to allow those folks to do what they're paid to do. Um, most engineers, if you're at a product company, need to be shipping. They don't need to be spending time with auditors. And anytime they're taken away from that, and I don't know for those out there that have hired software engineers, they're expensive. So, their time is very valuable. We don't want their time with EY. We want their time in front of their computer. Um, evidence quality over evidence quantity. I don't know what has happened in GRC where we figured out that the amount of controls matters. Let's focus on the quality of EV evidence, automated, testable, verifiable. Um, and really I think there's a desire to always throw tools at things. Um, especially in GRC. I used to teach at the SNS Institute um, a course on cloud compliance and we used to talk about living off the land. um going to find those people uh going to find the people that you work with and find the tools that they already use. Work with those tools and let them administer them. They already like that tool. Instead of going to them and saying implement this new tool, find out what they use. I promise you those tools probably can help you out with the stuff that you're trying to do. And it's going to mean a lot more to them that you tried to understand what they do versus throw another tool at them. So, as I wrap up, I I I really hope that you all kind of take away um one thing that uh I don't think this is the future. I think this is now I I think this field needs practitioners who can bridge that gap between compliance theory and technical implementation. Um and I think if we embrace this concept of GRC engineering um the GRC profession will will really and GRC professionals will become those essential bridgebuilders um who can really define the future of compliance in in these cloud environments. And I don't think um as I talked about this warning earlier, this isn't the end of GRC, but I do think it's the end of how we've done GRC. Um, and and hopefully everybody in this room can look back and say, "Hey, in Denver, June 30 of 2025, GRC died. GRC engineering was was birth." Um, and uh, I'm excited for what this means for the future. So, thank you all um, for for attending. Appreciate it. And, um, happy to answer any questions. Nice work, AJ. Um, we got a question from Slack U for back on the slide where you had the LinkedIn post. He said, "Uh, did you like your own LinkedIn post?" You know, so what I uh shout out to Jason for that question. I um I like the question. I appreciate it. Um so with the LinkedIn algorithm, I'm a little bit of nerd on LinkedIn. So, when you first post, um, there's a little bit of a window there where if No, I'm not denying it. I'm telling you why I did it. Um, so if you see your post dying, give it a little give it a little like and it might pop back up in the algorithm for people to like it. So, there's your LinkedIn trick for the day. That's a That's a pro tip right there. Pro tip. Yeah. All righty. Uh, any questions? I'll go around the room here. I'll start from the front and kind of move back. I love that. Whoever wrote that, I'm sending you a book. Hey, what's happening AJ? What's up? Question for you. So, let's say I'm a GRC analyst. I haven't really touched, you know, any any database or server whatsoever, right? Where do I start? Because, you know, you're telling me to go from a GRC analyst to an engineer. Where where do I start? Do I start learning how to code? Do I start, you know, looking at the database? Do I start learning how how it network works? Where do I start? Because a lot of us quote unquote GRC analysts, we may not have been exposed to these technologies much during our collegiate curriculum or boot camp whatsoever. Yeah, good question. I think um one thing I learned as a uh as a startup founder and somebody was building product for a while is that um you have to iterate and go small. So I would say start small. Find one activity, one control that you're currently working on, one thing and think about and think about it from a first principal perspective. Not what do I have to prove to my auditor, but what are we actually trying to do with this control? What's the risk that we're trying to reduce or mitigate? And then think about how do my users do this control? Because I think in GRC, we don't think about it like a product. And you cannot build a product without thinking about your end users. So as that GRC analyst before you think about the technologies and do I learn how to code do I learn this start small find one thing that you do today that's manual go learn the people the users that are impacted by it what they're doing and then start to brainstorm and and identify you're going to end up at some point dipping your toes in some Python it's it's inevitable in this in this field especially as a GRC engineer you're going to have to understand the cloud that you're you're so these are baseline things you're going to have to do some of that stuff. But before you even get there, think about it from a first principles perspective. Start what are we actually trying to do and start small. Pick one control at a time and just continue to iterate. Do you have a guide? Yeah, I actually do have a book. It just came out today. Uh we'll uh we'll try to squeeze in a couple more questions here. Thanks. A uh excellent presentation. I appreciate it. Thank you. Uh I think it was my favorite one of the day surprisingly. So just wanted to throw that out there. um have you thought about like dumping all that raw Excel data into like a quicksite dashboard and keeping it alive for metrics and you know keeping it dynamic? So we do have it in a in a quicksite dashboard um right now actually. So that I'm glad you mentioned that and that's I think another example of leveraging the native AWS services because we we kind of have this lambda function that we call an evidence harvester and we just throw all of the evidence into a Dynamob table, do some hashing on it and then that is visualized in QuickSite for the security team of of the folks we're working with. So yeah, it's another way that you because it's all integrated as you know super easy to do that. Yep. Nice. Let's do one last question here. Great talk. Thank you. Have you used Drada? And if so, what do you think of it? I know that's one of the I think the one of the only GRC engineering platforms I've seen. Yeah, there's uh there's Drada, there's Vanta, um Secure Frame. I I probably know way too much about those tools than I should because I was a founder in the space and I competed against them and I am a crazy competitor. So, I studied them and know them too well. Don't like them that much. Um not because they did anything, just cuz I'm a competitor. Um I think those tools are great. Um I think they have done a good job of helping um accelerate early stage startups goal to to automate. However, I think the process of of how those tools are marketed and and sold is a part of the reason why I say the things I do about sock 2 and where the industry is going because we've turned this from a security thing to sock two in a week, sock two in a box. and that's not what it's about. Um, and and then on top of it, there's a little bit of a dynamic between the auditors and the tool and which auditors will use the tool. And as you start to move up the stack as a more mature company and you have to work with the EY or even top 20 firms, they're going to be a little bit more skeptical about trusting a green check mark. And I think we're still missing that. I actually was just looking at um DRA the other day because they have an API now um that they that they released and I think that is huge if these GRC tools can allow you to start feeding data into them to visualize it for the auditors cuz the auditors are are getting comfortable with it. To me, that's better than me just accepting some random check mark that I don't even know if it's hooked up to my all my accounts. I don't know the scope. I don't know anything. Um so I I think they're on a good start. um obviously they've had a ton of success um and are doing great things, but I think there's a lot of opportunities to do things with native services um before you go out and invest in those tools. Great questions. I know we have a bunch more questions, so I will encourage you right now. We're going to be coming up on our next session. If you got more questions, I would say follow up with AJ afterwards. I'm sure he's more than happy to talk through anything and everything in GRC engineering. Uh let's give him one last round of applause. We appreciate it.
