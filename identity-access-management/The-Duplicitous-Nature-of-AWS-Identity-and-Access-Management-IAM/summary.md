- **Talk Type**: Cloud Security

## Summary

This talk explores the complexities of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), focusing on the concept of "duplicate permissions"â€”where two or more distinct IAM permissions can achieve the exact same outcome. The speaker, Jason Cow, demonstrates how this duplicity exists across various AWS services, creating challenges for security management, detection, and policy enforcement, as denying one permission may not prevent the action if its duplicate counterpart remains allowed. The presentation highlights the inconsistencies in how AWS classifies these permissions and offers strategies for navigating this complex landscape.

## Key Points

- **Duplicate Permissions**: The core concept is that multiple, distinct AWS IAM permissions can produce the same result. Denying one permission in a pair does not block the action if the other is still permitted.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: The talk emphasizes that while AWS provides the tools and documentation, customers are responsible for understanding and correctly implementing security "in the cloud," which is complicated by IAM's nuances.
- **Examples Across Services**: Duplicate permissions are not isolated incidents but appear in services like AWS Account management, Identity Center (SSO), Simple Email Service (SES), Simple Queue Service (SQS), and Key Management Service (KMS).
- **Causes of Duplication**: Reasons for these overlaps include different API versions (e.g., SES v1 vs. v2), separate permissions for console and API actions, and service rebranding (e.g., SSO to Identity Center).
- **Inconsistent Classification**: A significant challenge is that duplicate permissions are often classified differently (e.g., `Write` vs. `Permissions management`). This inconsistency complicates automated policy analysis and security posture management.
- **AWS's Mitigation Efforts**: AWS has attempted to address these issues through permission retirement (e.g., `aws-portal` prefix), documentation updates, and the introduction of specific condition keys like `ses:ApiVersion`.
- **Detection and Prevention Challenges**: The existence of duplicate permissions complicates monitoring in CloudTrail and creating effective preventative controls like Service Control Policies (SCPs), as security teams must be aware of all possible ways an action can be performed.

## Technical Details

- **Services Discussed**:
    - AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
    - AWS Account Management
    - AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)
    - SES (Simple Email Service)
    - SQS (Simple Queue Service)
    - KMS (Key Management Service)
    - DynamoDB
    - S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- **Examples of Duplicate Permissions**:
    - **Account Management**: `AWS portal modify account` vs. `account put contact information`.
    - **Identity Center (SSO)**:
        - `SSO put permissions policy` vs. `SSO put inline policy to permission set`.
        - `identity store create group membership` vs. `SSA directory add member to group`.
    - **Simple Email Service (SES)**:
        - `SES send raw email` vs. `SES send email` (for raw emails).
        - `SES send templated email` vs. `SES send email` (for templated emails).
        - `SES update account setting enabled` vs. `SES put account setting attributes`.
        - `SES put identity policy` vs. `SES create an email identity policy` / `SES update email identity policy`.
        - `SES delete identity policy` vs. `SES delete email identity policy`.
    - **Simple Queue Service (SQS)**: `SQS add permission` vs. `SQS set q attributes` (when setting a resource policy).
    - **Key Management Service (KMS)**: `KMS retire grant` vs. `KMS revoke grant` (for deleting a key grant).

- **Key Technical Concepts**:
    - **Permission Classification**: AWS categorizes permissions into types like `List`, `Read`, `Write`, `Tagging`, and `Permissions management`. The talk highlights inconsistencies, such as `SQS set q attributes` being classified as both `Write` and `Permissions management`.
    - **Service Authorization Reference**: A new feature providing programmatic JSON access to all actions, resources, and condition keys. The speaker noted a recent update that added more accurate permission annotations.
    - **IM Condition Keys**: Mentioned `ses:ApiVersion` as a way to distinguish between SES API v1 and v2 calls in a policy.
    - **CloudTrail**: Duplicate permissions can appear as different events in CloudTrail, complicating detection and monitoring. For example, `set contact address` is not the same event as `AWS portal modify account`.
    - **Policy Types**: The talk touches on Identity-based policies, Resource-based policies, Permission Boundaries, and Service Control Policies (SCPs).

- **Methodologies & Strategies**:
    - **Deny by Default**: To properly block an action, you must deny all duplicate permissions associated with it (e.g., for SQS policy changes, deny `add permission`, `remove permission`, and `set q attributes`).
    - **Allow and Monitor**: For complex cases, allow necessary permissions but implement robust monitoring to detect unexpected behavior.
    - **Purpose-Driven Configuration**: Create IAM policies with a clear understanding of the nuances to build a holistic security strategy.

## Full Transcript

All right, welcome back to track 2 with our final talk today before lunch. And before we get into the session, this session is session sponsor for uh this session is Whiz. But I'm going to tell you something that you may not know, which is that Ford Cloud is only possible because of the great sponsors that Ford Cloud has. And they are actually here because they want to talk to you. This is where you make the noise. Okay, we practiced this before lunch and clearly I just didn't give a strong enough cue. But even if you are not a buyer, the sponsors are here to talk with you about their products. Be curious. Wander around during the lunch. Ask them what they do. If you don't know what they do, if you haven't seen their product in a while, ask to see a demo. And with that, I'm going to introduce our next speaker, Jason Cow from Fog Security. um with a talk title that certainly can only exist at forward clouds. The duplicitous nature of AWS identity and access management amate cal for those of you who don't know I work at fog security where I'm the founder and I'm talking about the duplicitous nature of AWS identity and access management IM. So, a little bit about me. Uh, I ran a team that built out cloud security at Fidelity Investments. Uh, and then I did offensive cloud security consulting at Ptorian. Uh, I did le security research and solutions engineering, cloud query. And lastly, I'm now building better data perimeters and preventing cloud ransomware at fog security. But you're not here to listen to me talk about myself. You're here to listen to me talk about IM. So, let's get going. So the agenda today is we're going to first talk about AWS IM and the shared responsibility model and how that affects our understanding and how we secure IM. Next we're going to talk about duplicate IM permissions and then we'll talk about some of the AWS provider resolutions and what it looks like in AD as in practice. We'll then talk about some of the complexity of IM which I'm sure you're aware of and then lastly we'll talk about best practices management of IM. So AWS IM uh show of hands a little bit of participation here. So if you're watching live, you can't see all the hands in the room, but who has written AWS IM policies before? And by that I mean at least one IM policy. Okay, so mostly everyone in the room. I promise I'm not lying. So who uses their own IM policies and not just AWS manage policies? Okay, a fair number as well. Uh, who has written a resource-based policy such an S3 bucket policy or SQSQ policy or KMSQ policy? Great, a lot of hands. And then, sorry, this might get a little bit tiring. Who finds AWS IM complex? Okay, a lot of hands as well. And the last fun question, who finds AWS IM to be simple? Do you want to give this presentation? Anyways, I also find AWS IM complex. So, I am in that boat as well. So, a quick primer in AWS. There are over 18,000 permissions and 200 plus services. Uh chart on the right um basically shows the growth uh over the last two years from 2020. So 7,000 around 7 uh in 2020 and goes all the way up to 18,000 in 2025. I checked this morning at breakfast as some of you may have seen me with my laptop out. As of this morning, there are 18,724 permissions and 16,975 API methods. And that covers over 444 service prefixes from looking at the console. Um I'm not great at math uh but looking doing a little math problem here. There's 200 plus services and 400 plus uh service prefixes. So there must be at least one service that has multiple service prefixes and that's some of the talk that we'll talk about in a little bit. So ADS IM most of you know what this looks like. So I'll be quick uh quick primer on what it looks like right uh there's different types of policies. The part on the right is what a policy may look like. I love that. I love the uh domain language and how it looks like and how to break it down. Right? So in this case we have I SQS add permission Lambda add permission Lambda list IM get start and you may have seen some of those before in the past. Again we're not really going to focus on that just a primer on what AWS IM can look like. What we're going to talk about next though is a shared responsibility model and you may have heard this a lot right AWS talks about it different cloud providers talk about it and this is actually pulled directly from AWS. Uh so different ways to look at this and we won't go into all the detail here is we can think of it as the customers so us most of us in this room are responsible for security in the cloud right and AWS responsible for security of the cloud you may have also heard of what's above the line what's below the line but ultimately the customers in AWS works together to secure everything that you have in cloud um the other thing that we look at right is ads provides tools for you to use so tools like AWS IM uh block public access and there's an implied understanding that AWS provides documentation for you to understand and how to use our tooling. Right? Personally, I spent countless hours going through Adep's documentation. And I'd use IKEA furniture example here, right? When you buy a rug from IKEA, uh there may not be instructions, right? You just take it out of the plastic packaging and you unravel it, right? But when you buy a bookcase or some other piece of furniture with a name that I probably can't pronounce, there are instructions on how to use it. And that's what we think about with AWS. We think about the shared responsibility model. Uh I love dictionary definitions. So, we'll start with this. What is the meaning of duplicate uh or duplicity right is you know does it consist of something that has where we see double and in this case right duplicity the second example is the quality or state of being double or doubled so this wouldn't be a talk in 2025 without looking at uh or AI so this is perplexity and I know some of you may prefer chat GBT or other ones uh but duplicate IM permissions explained but one of these is basically uh situations where a user group or role is granted the same or overlapping permissions and that's not exactly what we're talking about today. Um, and just for those who use chat GBT ask the same exact question. Um, it talks about redundant or overlapping permissions granted a user group or role etc. in IM. Won't go too much into details there. And again, these were pulled recently. So I promise they're not from a couple like a while ago. Uh, show me the meaning. What does it actually mean? What is our definition? And that's what we're actually going to talk about today. Two or more AWS IM permissions that correspond to the same outcome or effect. In some cases, managing one permission does not have any effect on the other permission. And thus, what makes it complicated or complex is denying one permission does not affect the usage of the other permission. Uh quick primer what we're not covering uh these are different ways of granting permissions to an IM user. Uh you may have seen this and yes, it's an IM user in this case. Uh you can put an inline policy. You can use a manage policy directly the user group inline policy if the user is in a group. Attach policy directly to a group. uh also resourcebased policies if it's in the same account but that's not really what we're going to talk about today. Another example of what we're not going to talk about uh shout out to Aiden Seal and Daniel Grizzl probably just butcher his name so I apologize for bringing this to my attention. There are different ways of reading or retrieving data in Dynamo DB not only Dynamo DB get item query scan you can also retrieve data with put item update item delete item depending on if you change a return values field on how you make that call. Additionally you can use DynamoB batch get item and part of QL select. So there are many different ways in Dynamo to retrieve data or read data. Again, we're also not covering S3 specifically deleting object. Uh S3 you can delete object, delete object versioning. You can also use put life cycle configuration to control life cycle expiration rules, which is another way to delete data in S3. Earlier this year, we covered some ransomware. Um and as you may be aware, S3 deletion of data is one aspect of ransom ransomware. Um so that you lose your data. So now that we've talked about AD as IM, we've talked about the shared responsibility model and what we're not going to cover. Here's what we are going to cover in duplicate permissions. And each of these slides will have the same format of multiple different ways of doing the same exact action. Um, this one's a little bit older and you may have seen this in email notification. Uh, this is for ads accounts and modifying contact information for account. So there's AWS portal modify account, account put contact information. And similarly uh there was one for adop portal modify account and account put alternate contact information. So in this case right you could al you can modify the alternate information including security billing and operations. Uh next we'll focus on denny center which is a service formerly known as SSO and there's an effect of adding permissions for per permission set. Um SSO put permissions policy is one way of doing it and in this case looking inline there's SSO put inline policy to permission set. And we're going to go rather quickly through some of these to show some of the impact. Next we have identity center again managing a user's group membership. Right? So looking at identity store create group membership SSA directory add member to group. Uh now we move on to SCES uh which is simple email service. You can actually they have two different versions of API and a lot of duplicate permissions there. So SES send raw email and SES send email also do the same thing of sending a raw email. Uh there's also templated email sending if you want to do SES send templated email or SCES send email again here. Uh one of the things about SCES is you can not only use it but you can manage it. So uh SCES has SCES update account setting enabled or SCES put account setting attributes and this allows you to enable or disable email sending across the entire SCES account in a region. Another management piece is looking email identity access. Uh so managing access to an SCES identity such as email address, you can put identity policy with SCES. You can also create an email identity policy and SES update email identity policy. And that wouldn't be complete without also deleting. So SES delete identity policy, SCES delete email identity policy or another example of duplicate permissions. We also have message cues in uh in AWS called simple Q service. And in this case, right, this is the one I probably gave as an example to some of you that I've talked in the hallways or previously at lunch or dinner or even breakfast, right? There's actually two different ways of changing the resourcebased policy in SQS. And you may be aware of this. Um SQS add permission, very similar to Lambda, right? When you add a permission, um you pass in a couple attributes and you can grant another account potential access to your queue. There's also SQS set Q attributes which um if you pass in a policy um that also allows you to set the policy itself on SQS and we have more details about this in a little bit. Uh another duplicate permission encryption management. So if you use KMS uh and you are familiar with a key grant uh we won't cover key grants in too much detail but key grants are another way of controlling access to a KMS key. So we have KMS key policies uh KS key grants which aren't available in the console but can pull through APIs and if you're aware of this right ad services often use key grants to authorize themselves to use like to do operations on your behalf. Um and again there's a little bit more nuance about key grants right such as nested key grants and how they use permissions etc. But there are two different permissions that actually remove access to a KMS key by deleting a key grant. There's KMS retire grant and KMS revoke grant. Uh so so far we've covered a couple different services. Right. So we've covered simple email service SCES. We've covered identity center formerly known as AWS SSO. We've covered simple Q service SQS. Key management service KMS and ADS account. So let's think about some of the trends, right? What why does this happen AWS? Uh from like a date perspective, right? Um maybe they're just older services, which is not necessarily the case here, right? SQS was 2004. Uh SCES was early 2011, SSO was 2017, identity center or the rebrand was 2022. um types of permissions which we'll talk about in a bit right AWS provides different buckets that you can use to categorize your permissions right list read tagging right and permissions management the previous ones we focus on are most likely to be write or permissions management some read um but we really didn't look at too much of the list and read permissions there so now that we've talked about a high level overview and also a couple examples of duplicate permissions let's talk about the differences of the permissions there so again managing Q permissions I alluded to this earlier Right? On one side is add permission, what it looks like from an AP or API perspective. The other side is what SQS set Q attributes. And if you can read that the outline in red is where you pass in the policy, right? Uh for account information, one is console only and one is API only. It also depends on how old your account is or how old your organization is, which makes this a little bit more complicated. Uh one is again right what it looks like in console and the other one is what it looks like in API. Uh we also have identity center. Uh this is an experiment that we ran to see what would happen. One was on API and the other one was console only as well. So that's similar difference, different service. And then lastly, SES email service. Uh it might be a little bit hard to read in the back, but what you see is if you use uh trying to create a policy in AWS, uh there have SES and SESV2, but the prefix is still the same. Um just so you all are aware a little bit of history. SESV1 is first introduced in 2011 and then SESV2 the API was introduced in 20120. Uh and the difference for deleting a key grant um this is actually how we grant the permission. Um so you can create uh grant permissions to retire a grant via a KMS key grant. Um so in this case right there's two different ways of doing that. You can either add it to the grantee principal or the retiring principle. Um so the bottom example is a grantee principle. The top one is a retiring principle. Um, and the interesting thing is I believe you can actually deny this via an IM policy, but you can't actually grant permissions through an IM policy. And then KMS revoke grant um permissions via key policy. Um, as some of you are aware um key policies are unique where the permissions must actually be granted in the KMS key policy. And the default key policy you get from AWS is actually delegation policy within your account which in like somewhat of an implicit allow um but not quite an explicit allow. Uh so some of the differences that we covered so far uh we've talked about how to grant permissions. So for KMS that's KMS key grant versus KMS key policy. We talked about API versions V1 and V2 for SSO or for SCES, identity center and SSO which is a little bit of a rebrand and console versus account API which is account and identity center. In certain cases, right, for console versus API, we've seen this where although we think the console and API permissions should be exactly the same. Um there are some examples where release a service and it's console only or has very limited support and that is probably the reason why we see some of these changes. So we've covered all those the differences. Let's talk about how does help us manage duplicate permissions. Uh so this one I actually really liked. I'll go into a little bit more detail here. In July 2023, two years ago, ADS actually tried to retire Adob's portal prefix permissions. Uh they sent out email to everyone that was affected and they actually released um a lot of documentation and sent out email including you know if you're using this there's a bulk policy migrator script you can check. They're very seems like they held a lot of hands for this which is fantastic right and this note is actually pulled straight from the ads documentation basically saying hey we retired this and then a little bit of nuance about whether your account or organization was created at a certain time or not another one is IM condition keys so I actually reported the SCES uh version thing to ad security shout out to them um and what they did was they actually implement API key which is probably not how I would do it um but there is a condition key called SES API version from what I've seen it is probably the only condition key that has API version in there and it filters action based off the SES API version. So quick policy snippet on the right um on how to use it use a string not equals SES API version uh version two. Uh and then in some cases right there is documentation only. So if you look at SQS add permission or set Q attributes um they talk about how to actually deny anyone from um changing an SQSQ or resourcebased policy. um in this note which I think is great. Uh to remove the ability to change Q permissions, you must deny permission to the add permission, remove permission and also set Q attributes actions in your IM policy. Uh another one is just documentation. So retire grant and revoke grant. There's a lot more documentation here on basically how to deny or what you can do with this. Uh but interesting thing here, right, is required permissions. Permission to retire grant is determined primarily by the grant. For details, see this um other documentation. Um but that's something else that we'll see. Another example is this is what ADA is calls dual authorization. So this for identity center um hidden in the identity identity center pages but basically they have the operation on the left and API actions before or after a certain date. Uh so a summary of what AdWS has provided right we've looked at condition keys we've looked at documentation we've l console versus API retirement permissions and basically if you have things or resources created before or after a certain date so that being said let's talk about complexity for duplicate permissions as some of you are aware uh looking through this right trying to figure out what's in cloud trail or not if I'm looking for let's say SQSQ and seeing what policies change I would have to look for both the set Q attributes and ad permissions they won't show up the same in um cloud trail. Another example is uh for looking at the account um this was the put contact information um or the AWS portal permission and one of the complexities additional complexity here is that the set contact address is not the same permission as AWS portal modify account. So as you may be aware right cloud trail and IM do not always have a onetoone mapping. And then this is something I actually talked to Patrick. I know you're in the crowd um about this morning because I was actually really excited about a release yesterday for the service reference and we'll we're about to talk about that. But SQS ad permission is classified as a permissions management SQS set Q attributes is classified as right. So if we're looking at classifying our policy or seeing what our you know our principles can do that doesn't always match up right. So if I don't give someone SQSQ add permission I may think they only have right attributes and I only give them SQS set Q attributes. But the interesting thing which I'm alluding to that popped up yesterday on this release for service references is if you look at the bottom right corner that's from their documentation. It's only classified as a write operation and there's an N of one. So there's only one category on the left is something we pulled from the service reference. And if you're unaware right the service reference authorization is a huge listing of all the actions resources and condition keys available for every single service in AWS. They recently made this programmatically available via JSON files. on the left they just added these annotations yesterday and what we see is that it's not just an array it's not an N of one but in this case a set Q attributes can be both right and a permissions management which makes sense um there are certain tools out there that do overrides right if the permissions don't seem to match up from like our understanding we've also like I've in the cloud security forum I've also worked with other people to report some of these we're like hey this doesn't really match up you know this might not be a right action this seems more like permissions management and we've seen that a couple times and there's a lot you know again open source tooling other tooling that has overrides for those. But in this case, this kind of breaks the model where this isn't consistent, right? Because we see one where it's just an N of one and another one where it's an N of two or more. And then another one right for SSO put permission policy is classified as permissions management. SSO put inline policy permission set is classified as a right and the right side example pulling from the console again. Uh so we've talked a lot about the complexity of IM uh management and prevention. We're going to talk a little bit more about that. Right. So we alluded to complexity of the classification taxonomy of these IM permissions. uh you know we've talked about a little bit right like if we look at an allow and monitor strategy what does that look like right do we allow if the actions are very similar and they're classified very similarly right it's easy to block both for example if I don't want anyone to modify my SES uh account setting attributes I can block both those permissions right and that's fairly straightforward however if I'm trying to use an API version that becomes a little bit more complex because as a security team I really can't tell my um developers to use certain APIs right um we can see RCPs and SCPs so resource control policy and SCPs we can set perimeter as we want, right? And making sure we're creating some sort of data perimeter or infrastructure parameter. And then lastly, right, what we talked about earlier is like how do we deny action or access to actions? The SQS um permission I, you know, example I'd give is it if we're trying to block resourcebased policies, yes, we can block SQS ad permission, but we really can't block SQS set Q attributes because it does other things outside of just setting policies there. Uh so this moves us to our conclusion. Uh there are duplicate permissions that exist in AWS and it's not just the same permission in multiple different policies. It's multiple permissions that get us to the same point, right? Uh we've talked a little bit about how to define an IM strategy, right? Looking at whether it's a deny, whether it's allow but monitor, whether it's an allow. Um what I'd recommend is from a detection prevention strategy, right? Work with your security tooling, right? Um and work with, you know, other colleagues, etc. to figure out exactly what it is. And the last piece, right, is strategy. Purpose-driven IM configuration and understanding nuance of this is very difficult, right? It helps us understand a holistic strategy, but there's a lot of nuance to IM. There's a lot of nuance to the permissions as we exhibited with the duplicate permissions that we've seen. Uh, and then lastly, future plans and contact. We've only gone through a couple different services as we called out. There's over 200 plus services and 18,000 permissions. So, there will be future research and tooling for duplicate permissions. We also have more to come for ads IM and data parameters. Reach out if you're interested. Uh, here's my email and my contact information for LinkedIn. And just so you're aware, we plan on doing more in the future to unfog cloud security. So they're no longer seeing double. Uh again, reach out and if you have any questions, happy to answer them. Thanks for your time. All right, we have a fair bit of time for questions if anybody has questions. Great talk. Thank you. Uh I just had a question. It's more related to conditions. Um, just a background, the reason why I think IM's a little easier is because that was my job at AWS. So, sorry for that. Um, but for um, have you ever dealt with double conditions and an IM policy statement? And how do you feel about that? What do you mean by double conditions? Uh, I had a customer ask me if they could make two separate conditions inside of an IM policy. It took a little work to get it done, but basically the first condition would be like, you know, string not like this and then string like this, and it would accept two different parameters. So I'm just curious if you've ever run into that and what do you think? Right. So I can't answer exactly off the top of my head but the I think what happens right is when we have multiple conditions within the same im policy the to me it's not quite logical and this might just be a me problem of like how those interact with each other right so if you have the same condition key you have multiple values within there or if you do like for all values for like any value right um that makes it really complicated so I think to me right I like when it's statements with just one um because then I can I think it's very purpose- driven right but then when it gets complex or has more to your point right they could have very specific reason to do that. Um, but for me like I think that's gets really complicated to try to figure out exactly what that policy is doing. Have you ever tried the uh verified permissions API and access analyzer to see which condition key wins? Uh I have not tried verified permissions but I just got a question about access analyzer and I'm a huge fan um about how it looks at like data parameters and also the zone of trust other identity and access questions in relation to comp complexity of IM. How do you feel about permission boundaries and how does that affect like when you're basically like a user set to a group and then to a permission boundary? How did do you feel that those overlap or take over or whatever based on where they're set? So, this is again a personal preference is I would not use a permission boundary without using an SCP. So, I think the combination of those two make it possible just because of the granularity that is sort of hard to get with just one of them. Um, I think there's also a very interesting nuance in how like uh permission boundaries evaluate within an account. I think based off like a role and like the if you're actually using this like the assume role part of that. Um, but I think overall, right, like I really like permission boundaries. I think it's a great way to like add a like a boundary, right? And if we're like if you grant someone the ability to create another role, right, you can add the permission boundary say like you must have this. And I think that condition key going back to condition keys is brilliant, right? It makes total sense, but it sits a little bit outside of like I think the standardized how does a condition key affect what the request is or what does it look for in the request, right? I think permissions boundaries are one of the least well understood and applied features in the IM system. I would also add session policies um which I haven't seen an effective use of yet, but I'm very curious how those work well. One more here in the front. Um hi, thank you for the presentation. Uh maybe it's a um an issue with translation from Azure to uh AWS, but I'm not familiar with the um permissions management like the property that you showed that is showing up as of yesterday. Isn't that what it was? The showing up as true. Let me see. And that was kind of this right right is permission management. Can you explain that more in depth? Yeah, sure. So, uh AWS class I'll take a step back first. classifies permissions in a couple different buckets. The permission management one is typically tied to like adding a policy, creating a user or I can't remember exactly how they're classified in IM. Um, but it's a little bit different from a right. I think the right to me is about creating resources while the permission management is like okay am I adding a resourcebased policy right like to S3 right am I putting a bucket policy that allows access from somewhere else right um so that's how I see the permission management um category or the bucket of permissions and that way if you look at like you're looking IM policies to attach your IM roles right and you're trying to classify them is it just someone that has right access or is it someone who has a little bit more management per uh ability right and they can add permissions or grant someone else access right and escalate Did I answer? I think so. Okay. All right. Well, we have quite a bit of time before lunch, but let's go ahead and just give him one more round of applause for a great session. Thanks
