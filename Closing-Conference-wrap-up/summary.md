**Video Link**: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edcr__VzLUU)

- **Author**: Scott
- **Talk Type**: Conference Update

## Summary

This talk is a "State of the Union" for the Forward CloudSec conference, presented by organizer Scott. He provides a transparent overview of the conference's mission, history, finances, and operational statistics. The presentation details the growth in budget and attendance, concerns about the plateauing of talk submissions and a decline in practitioner-led talks, and outlines the community's structure, including the board, organizers, and the adoption of open-source projects like Granted.

## Key Points

- **Mission**: The conference's mission is to "democratize security," ensuring easy access to world-class cloud security for everyone.
- **Independence**: It is an independent, practitioner-focused, 501c3 non-profit organization, not affiliated with any cloud provider or vendor.
- **Financial Transparency**: The budget and revenue sources were detailed, showing that sponsors cover the majority of costs. Expenses have grown by choice to enhance the conference (e.g., becoming a two-day event, adding speaker honorariums).
- **Speaker Honorarium**: A $600 honorarium for speakers was introduced in 2025 to encourage more talks from practitioners whose companies might not pay them to speak.
- **Talk Submissions**: While the conference is healthy, talk submissions have stabilized, and there's a noticeable decline in the percentage of talks from practitioners versus vendors, a trend the organizers want to reverse.
- **Community Engagement**: The Slack community has many members, but active participation is low. The organizers are seeking ways to increase engagement.
- **Call for Volunteers**: There is a strong need for new volunteers and organizers to act as "understudies" for key roles like logistics, sponsorship coordination, and AV, ensuring the conference's longevity.
- **Open Source**: The organization's Technical Oversight Committee has adopted community projects, including the "Granted" tool, to ensure their continued maintenance.

## Technical Details

- **Organizational Structure**: The conference is run by a 501c3 non-profit organization with a Board of Directors and a separate set of conference organizers.
- **Conference History & Locations**:
    - 2020: Virtual
    - 2021: Salt Lake City
    - 2022: Boston (One-day conference)
    - 2023: Anaheim (Became a two-day conference)
    - 2024: Washington D.C.
    - 2025: Denver
- **Financials**:
    - **Expenses**: Increased over the years due to moving from virtual to in-person, adding an event planner, paying a hotel cancellation fee (when moving from Houston to Boston), expanding to two days, and adding a speaker honorarium in 2025.
    - **Revenue**: Primarily funded by sponsors. Ticket revenue is a smaller portion. A small surplus is maintained for a "rainy day fund."
    - **Ticket Prices**: Started at $100, increased to $150 in 2025, with an additional "personal supporter" ticket tier.
    - **Sponsorship Tiers**: Prices have increased over time. In 2020, a Bronze sponsorship was $1,000.
- **Statistics**:
    - **Sponsor Acquisitions**: 11 of the 51 total sponsors (22%) have been acquired after sponsoring the conference.
    - **Practitioner Talks**: The percentage of talks from practitioners (employees at non-vendor companies) has declined, which prompted the introduction of the speaker honorarium.
- **Community Projects**:
    - **Technical Oversight Committee**: A committee that can adopt and maintain open-source projects relevant to the community.
    - **Adopted Projects**:
        - A list of known AWS accounts.
        - The "Granted" project for CLI credential access.
- **Tools & Platforms**:

    - **Community Communication**: Slack is the primary platform for community interaction.

## Full Transcript

Hey, hey, hey. Heat up Okay, welcome everyone. Uh so this is the state of the union where we basically just talk about forward cloud sec the conference the budget things like that where things are at. Um and so the last state of the union address was in 2023. It's been 2 years since then. So we felt it was a good time to update. Uh last time that we gave um the state of the union address uh I would say things were growing at what seemed like an exponential rate in that uh we didn't know was this going to become a thousand person conference 10,000 a million person conference we weren't sure you know the sky seemed the limit um things have plateaued and uh we've also you know wanted to maintain it at the level that it's been at um but I want to in this presentation give I guess some just various bar charts is really it's just a whole bunch of bar charts. Um but uh but I wanted to just kind of talk about where where we're seeing things are at with a bunch of different things. Um and and some of those bar charts show some areas where we think that we need to improve but in general it's also you know a way to open up the discussion for you all to find out where you think we need to improve as well. Um the last presentation also the last day of the union was primarily about the history of why we created the conference. Um and so I I recommend you watch that one. This one doesn't have quite as much of that type of information in it. Uh but I did want to have one slide just to kind of remind people um that the mission of the organization is democratize security that every individual and organization should have easy access to worldclass security in the cloud and so we make a bunch of decisions that are kind of based around this. Um, so first of all, I guess the the the conference um is owned by a uh 501c3 nonprofit organization. Um, but but we make a lot of decisions like trying to keep the tickets uh prices very low. Um, live streaming this for the people that can't travel here, putting up the recordings for people um so that they can watch it. Um, so we we try and do the all those things. We also, you know, we're an independent conference. Uh, something that breaks my heart sometimes is we've heard like one person thought we were associated with a cloud provider, like we were actually owned by a cloud provider, which to us is mind-boggling. We are the history of the conference is very much not that. Um, but uh but yeah, so we're we're independent. We're not affiliated with any provider, vendors, anything like that. We're independent from, you know, our sponsors. We don't give sponsored talks to people. Um, we're practitioner focused. The people that are actually trying to secure um, you know, their companies, those are the people that like this conference was made for. Um, and and that it is like a community organization that, you know, they're all the people that are a part of the conference all work for different companies. Um and and we do want this to be a thing where that hopefully you as an attendee of the conference also feel like you're not just an attendee, but you're part of a community, you're part of a group, um and that you can make an impact as well, that you can come up and talk to us and volunteer for things, get involved in various ways. Uh so, first of all, um the board of directors for the uh nonprofit organization is shown here. I used everybody's Slack photos. So, let me just swap in Chris's actual LinkedIn photo since um so that he's recognizable beyond a Lego character. Um but the the board of directors, we do like 1 hour of work a year or something. Basically, it's just making sure that the conference is and everything else that's a part of the organization um is living up to that mission. Um, so the conference organizers, they it they're the ones that do a lot of work. Um, and unfortunately for us as the board of directors, we're all the same people pretty much. Um, and so Kim, um, the last individual there, he's he's not on the conference organizers for North America, but he is for Europe. Um, and I'll talk about that here in a in a moment. Um, but we're now in our sixth year. Um many of us started with um the very first year of the conference. Um and for many of us this has been like a constant in our lives as we've changed jobs working in the tech industry. You know after 6 years like chances are some of us have moved on to different jobs and this has been like a constant for us. We've been able to see in the background of video conference calls children grow up beards grow down. Um it's it's uh so so yeah I mean and and we we realized like being in our sixth year were some of the organizers some of the organizers have moved on to other things. There were there were some in the first years that that um you know did move on to other things and some of the organizers also you know will eventually move on to other things as well. And so, you know, we do want to bring in new organizers um and volunteers and and other people to help with the conference in different ways. The conference has talks um as part of it. That's the main thing that happens here. Um and so the CFP reviewers have a very important job. And so we have additional folks involved in the CFP review process. Um, so the CFP reviewers include not only all of the organizers, but then also these other individuals and then also some individuals that because of their jobs or whatever chose to remain anonymous as well. Um, so there's about 20 people involved in that review process. Um, and we do that in order to ensure that you know there's a diverse range of subjects and interest represented across the different reviewers. some people, you know, focus on certain clouds or certain technologies or, you know, uh, GRC or something like that. And so we have we have people that have different interests and we want to make sure that we're pulling in talks that that represent all of these different types of interest for to people because we recognize that for the attendees there's also a lot of different interests from people. Um, briefly I'll mention that there is the EU um, conference as well and so that largely has a different set of organizers. I really know very little um about that conference because I'm not one of the organizers for it. Um let me again switch in LinkedIn photos for people uh so you can actually see their faces. Um but uh but yeah, so it other than uh Chris and Aaron um who are also on the US or the North America um conference organizing committee uh everybody else is is EU based over there. Um and one of them may be moving to the EU soon I guess uh of the US folks. Um uh also I wanted to mention for the EU though that the CFP and call for sponsors is still open over there as well. Um, so I think the CFP is open till July 11th, I think I was told. Um, but but yeah, so that is open as well. Uh, all right. So, I guess I'll start jumping into some things. Um, so this is your first bar chart. Um, I guess there'll be a lot more of these. Um, but one of the things that the the conference um has done for a number of years now is a scholarship program. Um, and even though I guess we're just like picking some of the scholarship recipients and they're only spending like two days with us here, uh, in some ways I feel like a proud parent when I do hear like that they've gone on to have success in various things. Um, so uh, Rita who uh is mentioned here with with this quote that he uh, they provided us um, they were a scholarship recipient in 2024. um they are now going off to speak at Besides Las Vegas this year. So um so yeah, so we're we're proud of like those types of things. Um but we've had other recipients have gone on to join the security teams of Apple, AWS, Graphfana, various other um companies. Um, one thing about this bar chart here, uh, is you can see in the first years basically like almost everybody that applied for the scholarship got it. Um, and, uh, and and now we we do have more people applying to the scholarship than we have spots available. And it is really difficult for us to pick who's going to receive that because really all of the ones that apply should receive it. And so, um, something that we want to have is this call for mentors here with this QR code that, you know, we're able to help out those scholarship recipients, like provide them this experience for 2 days. Um, but there's these other scholarship applicants that we don't do anything for, unfortunately. Um, and and so providing some mentoring, if you guys are interested in that, um, is something that I want to have a call for action on there. All right. Um, so to give some information about the bar charts that I'm going to show, which are basically how things are have changed over the different years, uh, I want to just give like a quick history uh, of the conference and and where it's moved to. Um, so I start out with the virtual conference, which is I put it in Canada cuz I there was empty space on that map. Um, that was in 2020. Uh but then we moved to Salt Lake City, we moved over to Boston, moved over to Anaheim or LA, moved to DC. Um and then we've come out here to Denver. Uh from the DC, it also there was the EU conference spawned from that. So there's the Brussels and Berlin conference there. Um let's see. All right. Uh so um I'm going to show a whole bunch of data uh I guess about this conference. I don't know if anybody other than the organizers are interested in, but I figure we we'd show it to you all. And and part of this is because um one, you know, we want people to feel like they're involved in the conference, that this is the community that that you should feel a part of in some way. And and part of that is is letting you see some of this. Um another part is like I I believe that transparency is important. Like I'm going to provide some information about our budget. like legally we don't have to tell you about our budget, you know, as as uh you know, even though it's a nonprofit and everything like that, but I think I think that's important because that type of transparency like gives you trust. It lets you see like where where is this money going to? Um and and yeah, basically just like why we're doing some of the things that that we're doing. Um I've got a lot of notes that I'm reading on things that I'm supposed to say um throughout all this. Uh, oh, the other thing is is that I'm going to be condensing like 6 years of meetings and conversations into like a couple bar charts. Um, so there's going to be a lot of nuance and explanation um that's going to be missing from all that. And so if you see something that you feel is like wrong or uh you know, yeah, just basically doesn't seem right there, there could be an explanation behind some of these things, reasons why we did various things. Um some of the things are arbitrary choices, some of the things are things we you know felt like we copied from other conferences that we'd been to in different ways. Uh but in general like you know we're we are proud of how we've made a lot of the choices behind the conference. Um so I guess the the first bar chart here though to give an explanation of things like this is a bar chart of the number of talks just so you can again get kind of an understanding the background for for the future bar charts that I'm supposed to that I'm going to be showing here. Um, blue is the number of talks on day one. Red is the number of talks on day two. So, you can see that in 2020 and in 2022, we were only a one-day conference. So, the budget, this is a a scary one to to show people, but it's something that um we wanted to we wanted to show cuz we think, you know, being transparent is important. Um the first thing that you probably immediately notice is like uh this is our expenses and seeing expenses go up and to the right uh you know can be scary. That is one thing you don't want to have up into the right usually but it is something we did by choice. Um and so like our our budget is something that we are basically like planning in advance and deciding what we're going to be spending on things. And then basically we go back um and we figure out okay how much are we going to charge sponsors and things like that and so we reverse engineer it in that way. Um so to talk about I guess some of this like 2020 was virtual so pretty much no cost. Um 2021 we were uh that was our first in-person conference. um 2022 we um had there's like a light blue section at the top and that is a cancellation fee that we had to pay a hotel because um we were originally going to be in Houston I think it was uh Houston, Texas cuz that's where Reinforce was going to be and then they made the last minute decision to switch up to Boston and so we had to switch up to Boston as well. Um and so we followed them there. Uh but we also added on an event planner. So so that's um part of that cost there. Uh in 2023 um we became a two-day conference again. So 2022 was a 1-day conference. So 2023 we basically doubled our hotel cost because we were now 2 days. Um in 2024 uh we were in Anaheim which ended up being expensive especially because of some food trucks that we brought in. So that added um a fair bit of expenses for for that. Um and then that brings us to 2025 where uh one of the big expenses you can see this year is that yellow section which is for speakers because this is the first year that we're providing um an honorarium for the speakers. And so uh basically in addition to providing hotels uh for them if if needed, we also provide uh $600 honorarium for them. uh as you know, thank you for speaking. But a big part of the reason why we did this was to try to get more talks from people that are practitioners or you know, basically they work at a company that they're not being paid as a full-time job to be a conference speaker. I I guess none of us none of the people that are speaking that's their full-time job, but it it is more like incentivized if you work at a cloud security vendor or something to talk at a cloud security conference. Um, so, oh, um, another thing is that for 2025, a lot of these costs are also like what we budgeted, what we planned for. And so, some of these costs are going to come down as we like figure out how much did we actually pay on things. Um, like one of the things is uh at the very top um there's like a some budget for the organizers. uh the organizers don't get paid but we did decide um last year I think that if like if an organizer is unable to uh you know if their if their employer doesn't pay for their flight and hotel to come for this conference we think it's reasonable to pay for their flight and hotel given the amount of work um that's involved and and last year uh I think we only had like one person do that and so this year we we budget some money but it'll be less money um because we probably all uh were able to have that done for us for the most card. Uh okay, so that was money going out. This is money coming in. Um so this is where the money comes from. Um what you'll see here is it largely tracks with the expenses um of the conference. Um it is a little bit more if you were to closely analyze the previous picture in this one. We do have slightly more money coming in. That's because we don't want to um like that's a thing we don't want to mess up. Um if we have less money than we spend then we have to like file for bankruptcy and somebody has to like you know foot the bill for various things I guess. Um so we do have a little bit more money coming in. We have built up um a little bit of a rainy day fund in case you know um there's another pandemic or there's um or economic troubles or you know sponsors don't pay or something like that. Um and uh but yeah, so I guess to to one of the takeaways from this picture is that the sponsors do pay for most of the conference. Um so you know, we always recommend people, you know, make sure you talk to your sponsors that are out there and stuff, you know, make sure that they they want to come back next year um and continue sponsoring. Um so you can see the the dark purple at the top there, that is the ticket revenue. Um and that's grown because um we have increased a little bit the ticket prices but it's also been increased the number of people at the conference and then also this year we had the personal um sponsor tickets um which had you know were more expensive than than the other tickets. Um there's also uh that green section there is like the lunch sponsors and I guess it's just lunch sponsors. I think we did maybe a happy hour something sponsor as well. Um but uh this you can also see how the uh Iguess prices for the different sponsor tiers have increased as well. Um so like back in 2020 bronze tier was like a,000 bucks. Um we we originally planned also to help you understand these numbers like the first year it was planned to be an in-person conference. Um we planned all that out and then obviously COVID happened and we had to switch to virtual. Um but but you can see how these different prices have increased over time. Um and one of the things is you know we we felt that uh you know the sponsors do get a lot of value and that we had the ability to increase some of those rates and and use that money to pay for the speaker honorarium in order to um ensure you know the the value of the conference for people. Um, another kind of interesting thing is, uh, we we saw a lot of sponsors kept getting acquired. We were like, I don't I don't know if this is causation or correlation, but, um, you know, it's it seems to be if you sponsor for CloudSc, that's a good thing for for you. Um, but uh, but yeah, so this just kind of shows like uh, which sponsors sponsored which year and which of them got acquired. Um, so 11 of the 51 sponsors have been acquired, which is 22%. Um, uh, for for better or worse, uh, AWS sponsored this year. And so it's that's going to hurt that statistic for being acquired because there's not many acquirers that can acquire Amazon, I don't think. Um, but uh, but yeah, so this is uh, that's that uh, this is how ticket prices have increased. So, we're generally $100 per ticket um and then have increased to $150 this year. Plus, there's also those personal supporter tickets as well. Um and and this is done partially because uh one there's the pro problem you've probably noticed that our tickets sell out very quickly and especially in that first batch. And so, we're trying to figure out what to do for that. Uh but then also, you know, we provide these lunches and um you probably look at that lunch and you think like that's not a good lunch. That's an $8 lunch. Um it's I I don't know what the price it's probably like $54. Yeah. $54 for that lunch and per day and and we're like and we can't bring in other lunches or anything. So we have to we have to pay that. So we make the choice like we want to provide lunches to keep people here otherwise everybody's going to leave. So there's some things that we just have to do I guess but but that's that's where that money goes. Um, this one is probably of no interest to anybody but the organizers, but I have it in here anyways cuz it's a chart I made one day. But this is basically uh what we do is we figure out like where when and where we're going to have the venue and then we like reverse engineer when we're going to do things like uh have the CFP opening and start selling tickets, closing the CFP and stuff like that. So that's just how you can see that information. Um this one is uh where we get into something that where we think is important to to talk about. And so this is um the talks submitted and accepted. And so so you can see in 2023 like things were on the up and up. We were getting more and more talks um submitted and then things have kind of stabilized from here. Um and so so that's become like a little bit of concern for us as well especially given you know this year we we paid the honorarium so we we assume that we may get more talks this year as a result of that. Um but that wasn't uh the case there. So so this is something that we're interested and if people have ideas behind um how we can do better if people also want to get involved in um trying to encourage more people to to speak at the conference as well. Uh we think we're we're in a healthy place. Um but you know you always want to be in a place where you have a decent number of talks to select from um and pick those. So um this one isn't going to make any sense to anybody um but it's uh this is something that uh I look at internally and so this is um basically like which companies are represented from the the different speakers. Um, and so we we look at this to try and see like do we have a lot of different companies? How many of these companies are vendors and things like that? So, um, unfortunately like I couldn't fit the 58 more like companies on there, but there's like a lot of companies. Yeah, it's been 115 companies I think have given talks so far um at forward cloud sector that we've had people that were employed at at one of those companies for uh but that data was used for this one which is also um something that is uh inviting conversation. Um, so what's important to see here is that the blue is talks that are from a practitioner. And so this basically means um a somebody that is employed at a company that is not a cloud security vendor. Um, and you can see that it has declined. And this was um specifically the problem that we were trying to tackle by paying um uh speakers um some money for their uh hotels to come out here. So this is something that that we do see as problematic given that it is a a conference that's focused on practitioners. Um I mean the talks that that we have from vendors uh you know are great and there's also like this um you know even though someone comes from a vendor they're oftentimes giving a talk that is very you know uh it may be exactly what a practitioner does in their job you know it just they happen to be working um at a vendor there. Uh but but anyways this is this is something that you know we we do want to try and address in some way. Uh this one is just our mailing list um how many sub like people subscribe to that I guess and so you can see it has grown um over time uh but something so I don't have all years for our slack data but this is the slack data for the past year of basically how many people are active in the slack how many people have posted in the slack. So this is the analytics for it. Um this is another thing that we are kind of concerned by is that uh we believe that we get a ton of value from the Slack. Um we we do you know constantly new people are being added to the Slack but they're not active. They're not really I guess like checking it. They're not posting it. They're not becoming an active member of the community for the Slack. Um and that's something that we don't really know what to do about uh because we get a lot of value from it. Um, you know, on the one hand, I'm like, don't ever change. I love this Slack and I'm worried about change, but on the other hand, like we do want to make it valuable to to more and more people and and have more people uh, you know, become a part of it and and actually become active participants in it. Uh, the next thing is we do have this thing called the technical oversight committee. Um, maybe somebody Chris or somebody wants to talk about this a little bit since I don't really know what to say. Um, but yeah, Chris, do you have can we give Chris a microphone if he wants to say something on this? Um, yeah. So, one of the people on the technical oversight committee just handed me the microphone. So, um, is he Oh, yeah, he is on. Yeah, he is on there, right? Yeah. I should have used his picture either. I know. Uh so you know one of the things is we have this legal entity and this legal entity can be doing things for us and you know the first thing that the technical oversight committee adopted was the because it was from one of your repos the the list of known AWS accounts. So that now sits in the forward cloud sect slack and it's a resource that's available to the community. Um, and we always kind of felt like we should be able to be there more for projects, right? You know, everybody's got an open source project. If you pass on, win the lottery, decide to get out of cloud security and go raise alpaca, what happens to your project that people depend on? Well, and then that happened. He didn't raise alpaka. was, you know, anthropic. But, um, you know, so we, um, adopted the, uh, Granted project because so many of us use this day-to-day to get access to our credentials. And let's face it, this is the application that has access to all of our cloud credentials. And if we learned one thing here this week, it's protect your cloud credentials. So, we didn't just want that to, you know, get handed off to some random person. So now it is really in the custodial whatever of this community under the opaces of the oversight committee under the opaces of the board. Yes, there's a lot of overlaps there but it's there. It's part of this community and yeah we're interested in anybody who wants to help. Cool. That's all we had I guess. Um yeah I guess if there's any discussion or anything from people um this is kind of like we were planning on kind of be an open panel but we didn't want to put we did get one question which is uh how can people get involved as volunteer really it's just reaching out to any of the organizers and um you know especially if you have areas that you think that you can help us improve on um because that that's one of the things that's a problem for us is people want to volunteer but then we're like I I don't know what work we have for people. Um so you know if people want to let us know about areas to to assist in I I would say that many of us need understudies. Um like I am moving to Europe. Uh I also am the one who finds the hotels every year. I have a great support network with Rising Media. But you know I also need somebody who can be like yeah like what's the menu we should get? Where should we get the speaker dinner? Things like that. You know it's not my decision. It's I gather the data, throw it to the board, uh or throw it to the organizing committee and everything else. So, I think like uh sponsorship coordinator, we could definitely use an understudy for what I call logistics, which is what I do, we could use an understudy for. Jiren may very well want to uh get somebody who can help with coordinating AV every year. We've got a great vendor that we use. Job's reasonably easy. Still, it'd be nice to have somebody who could uh help on that. So that's what I would say is the things that you see we need understudies for. Uh one thing I want to add is if there's other things that you think the forward cloudac organization more broadly not just this conference um but the board um could be doing. So you know we mentioned the technical oversight committee and then adopting granted. If you think there's other things that the organization could be doing and you're interested in leading that as well, um I think we would be very open to other people saying, "Hey, I want to add this thing." Um uh where you can just kind of take it and own it. So please don't just constrain yourself to the things that you see today. All right. I mean, I'm Yes. The the only thing I would say is just echoing, we don't have tasks to give people, right? This is a small organization. A lot of this this exists because people had an idea, talked about it with a few others, and then just grabbed the bull by the horns and ran with it. Um, so the best way to become a volunteer is, you know, call your shot, say, "This is the thing I'd like to own." And then, you know, take your shot. Um, we'll give you the support we can. Um, but, uh, you know, we all have day jobs, too. you might be able to just yell at me. Uh so first of all, first first for Cloud Set Conference uh had an awesome time. Thank you for this. Um other similar organizations like OASP CSA have uh annual memberships. Is that uh something that clouds wants to avoid or look into potentially um for member retention? I guess. So, first of all, like we've we've almost like avoided bringing in money sometimes like because we we don't really have needs for it. And so, um yeah, so that that's part of it. And yeah, we I guess I haven't considered it. Yeah, I don't think we need we don't need the money. Yeah. Um I as the treasurer um I have opinions. Um so the first thing I would say is we are a nonprofit organization and what that means is one we're not just trying to take in as much money as we can. Um and then second there's some you know we get some benefits from that in the US but there's also some obligations around how we act like we're not allowed to directly engage in for example political advocacy. Um and so my philosophy has always been that we should fund the mission and that if there's things that we want to be doing for the mission then we should try to fund that and not just try to penny pinch and get as much money in as we can. Um, and I will also say one other thing is I've also been a very big advocate of saying we should spend the money that we have on our mission. Um, and so as Scott has said, we've actually built up a pretty decent reserve and if you have a thing that you say, hey, I want to do this um, and maybe I need some seed funding um, to start it um, but we think that we can sort of make it sustainable over the long term. I think that'd be a great thing for us to do in a way as an organization to kind of diversify what we're doing and broaden our impact. Um, but to the extent that we want to try to like charge individual people, it's hasn't really been part of our financial model. You know, this conference itself um has funded over the years pretty much everything that the organization is needed. Most of the expenses are directly here related to the conference um as well as the EU organization it is selfunding um but you know there's going to be some additional money spent to support granted um there's some organizational expenses that we have as well related to like tax filings and all that um but you know if we need to do that I'm happy to do that but I want to think about be conscientious about how we use money if people are going to give it to us I want to be able to look them in the eye and be honest and says thank you. We are putting the money that you are giving us to a good use. So yeah, other people have questions. Feel free to uh don't be shy. Hi uh Scott, thank you so much for organizing this. This is my first time being at a security conference. uh got out of school last year. So, this is really good. Uh just a quick question, dumb question. Uh what's the story behind the logo of the cloud sec? I mean, I'm just curious like why did you choose that? Uh so, it's it's mostly the cloud which I think makes sense as a cloud security conference. Everybody has that. Uh and then the paper airplane uh is there and that's just cuz it's like playful I guess. I think I don't know where Aaron went. We we got a Fiverr to do our lo we got a Fiverr to do our logo year one and so that's the airplane over the cloud. Um and then last year I think we decided oh we should do something like specific to the city. So that's when we we first had an airplane going into the Washington Monument and then I was like how about it we goes over the Washington Monument. Um Yep. And that was so that was the first year we actually did a city specific themed logo and then we did one for Brussels in the Adammonium. Um and then this year obviously with the the Rocky Mountains. So um but it really did just come from some random dude on Fiverr who we paid 50 bucks to create us a logo back in 2020 when Yeah. Um and then do you want to talk about the name? Uh we we'll also mention like there was like the control tower in it which was kind of referenced to AWS control tower. Oh that's right there right the original logo also had the yeah uh airplane uh airport tower. Yes. Uh but yeah the name the name forward fwd cloudsec that just is because uh reinvent reinforce they're all like email um like headers. What's that? Rears. Remar is another conference that they did. Yeah. Um, so yeah, so we were just basically like playing a joke on them by calling ours FWD and then yeah, we we originally wanted to be called Bides or Bides cloud or something like that, but it turns out the Bides is very geographically focused and we would have had to get permission from every city we went to to have a Bsides in their city that wasn't organized by them. Uh, and so we kind of quickly abandoned the idea of being besides cloud to be forward clouds. Yep. Most awkward name ever. Every time I get a quote, it comes back as just cloudsack or something weird and I always have to corre correct the name. Anyone else? Any details for 2026? We Yeah, basically uh Yes. There will be one. There will be one. Yeah. The the way it works is uh we we do the conference, we we rest cuz we're exhausted, everything and then we start talking about where should it be start planning out the ven. I get anxious because like that graph I like it when that that one graph you showed of like how long before the event do we do things. I like it when we pick the venue and it's a really tall uh thing. It just makes me uh yeah, feel more comfortable. Um yeah, we've we've done this now enough times that I think we've got a plan. We've got a history with multiple hotel brands. Um we could go back to where we've been before. We could try something new. I think, you know, I don't know if anybody from the hotel is in the room, but $54 for that lunch was a little bit um but that's what that's the cost to get a room like this. you know, we we were either going to pay $30,000 to get the room or we were going to pay $30,000 for food and they give us the room for free. So, um yeah, and and hotels have a lot of advantage from a logistical standpoint of they've got all the chairs we need, they've got all the pipe and drape and stages and everything. So, it simplifies our lives a lot to do it at a hotel. If you know of good venues, uh please ping us in Slack. question. Is the plan goal to flip flop coasts for location? Um, no. It would be a nicity, but not a requirement. I think we have kind of started flipping flopping. Yeah, it was uh Salt Lake City to Boston, Boston to Anaheim, Anaheim to Arlington, Arlington to Denver. Um, so we kind of are on that vibe. We probably would keep it up. I think personally as the person who's leaving the country and not probably doing this all forever, I like the idea of just picking two hotels and sticking with them and then are, you know, that there isn't a lot that we have to do. Uh, I will say this, the only reason that we haven't really kind of settled on a date for next year is we don't know what's happening with Reinforce. And a lot of our sponsors, a lot of our speakers might have to be at that event. And if we drop our event the same day in a different city, we lose a lot of our community. Have you thought about going outside of the US, Canada? Maybe. Yes. Um, I think we have, in fact, we did, we did it last year in Brussels. We'll do it again this year in Berlin. Um, but for the North America events, I think we thought about Canada this year. It was very expensive. We thought about Canada again. And a lot of the feedback we've gotten from a lot of folks is they could go to Canada, they might not be able to get back into the US. Um and that that you know that becomes an impact for folks here who can't leave and come back. So do we do that? Do we lose those people to bring in folks who are outside who don't want to come in? There's pros and cons. Yeah, it's a problematic question. Yes. Anybody else tap in? Anybody else in the room? Yeah, to add to that conversation about Canada. I'm from Canada. I've been uh I've had some chats and I've talked to Chris about pushing to Canada, but yeah, considering that some people are concerned about coming back in the US uh if they get out of the country, um I don't see that happening for the next foreseeable future to be polite. So, and and I think it's not convenient if you live in Canada to fly to Europe, but there is an event you could attend there. Um on that I do think though um you know obviously I think most of us feel bad about the people who have those concerns about being able to come into the US and I do think that like I'm very happy that we launched an EU version last year to because one of our main goals is trying to make this accessible. Scott opened this discussion with our mission of democratizing this and so having an event outside of the US I think is really important for us given what's going on right now and if anybody is on the live stream listening and is thinking about hm the forward cloud sec down under you know just let us know. Um, anybody else in the room or on the Slack have questions? All right, cool. All right, thank you all. Yeah. Uh, I also want to say just one more thing, like especially thank you to everyone here. Um, if you didn't show up, we would be very lonely. Um, but you're all are the reason we're doing this. Um, and so without you, we wouldn't have a reason to be here. So, thank you all so much for your support. Whether this is your first forward class, whether this is your sixth um that you've been to, um, we appreciate this community. This is what we're about. And I want to shout out Mustache Power. Hey, give us a wave in the back. Thank you for 5 years now of helping us do this. We have live streams because of you. We have fast recordings. I think yesterday's recordings are already online. Um, and Matthew, if you're still in the room, thank you for helping us organize, find these events, and uh, we'll see you all next year.
